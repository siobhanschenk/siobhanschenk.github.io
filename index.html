            <p>I am currently pursuing my PhD in the Parfrey lab at UBC where I study the microbiome of kelps and their response to climate change. 
                My research combines field surveys and lab experiments, along with collaborations with the kelp farming industry. </p>
            <p>Outside the lab, I work on projects promoting data accessibility and work at the UBC library, where I provide data analysis consultations and develop R workshops.</p>
            <p>I am also an avid triathlete. I’m part of the UBC Triathlon Sports Club team and qualified for the 2024 70.3 World Championships.</p>

            <h2>Data Science and Open Data Access</h2>
            <p>A lot of research time and money is spent collecting data. However these data are often lost, not usable due to poor record keeping/being behind a pay-wall, or the analysis cannot be replicated. I am determined to change this through my own work and hope to help others do the same.</p>
            <h3>Formal Data Analysis Consulting Experience</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong> Data Analysis and Visualization GAA for the UBC Library:</strong> I provide one on one consultation for UBC students, staff, and Alumni who need help performing their data analysis in R and SPSS. Additionally, I develop and deliver workshops for the UBC Research Commons aimed at beginner R users.</li>
                <li><strong>Living Data Project Data Rescue Intern:</strong> I cleaned over 20 years of field data, which directly lead to an <a href='https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.4013' target="_blank">open access publication in <em>Ecology</em>.</a></li>
                <li><strong>Illumina Data Analyst for the publication </strong><a href='https://ami-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1462-2920.16582' target="_blank">"Manipulation of the seagrass-associated microbiome reduces disease severity".</a></li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Other Data Accessibility Projects</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Gathering baseline macoralgae data at an urban intertidal site</strong>: There is a lack of publicly accessible baseline data in ecology in general. My colleagues and I are working to change this for our local macroalgae (big seaweeds) by conducting monthly transect sampling at Stanley Park. We publish our data on an <a href='https://borealisdata.ca/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.5683/SP3/IKGB6E' target="_blank">open access database</a> and I developed an <a href='https://siobhanschenk.shinyapps.io/algae_transects_stanley_park/' target="_blank">RShiny app</a> for easier data visualization.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Kelps and Microbial Ecology</h2>
            <p>Kelps are vital for the health of temperate coastlines, providing habitat, food, and modifying water conditions within their canopy. Additionally, kelp farming is a growing industry, already worth billions of dollars annually. However, wild and farmed kelps are vulnerable to climate change. Thus, these valuable services kelp provide are at risk.</p>
            <p>Microbes, bacteria in particular, have been used as a toolkit to increase terrestrial crop resistance to unfavorable conditions for a long time now, but we have a much more limited understanding of the bacterial community of kelps and other marine life than in terrestrial systems.</p>
            <p>Through my PhD thesis work in the <a href="https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~parfrey/parfrey_lab/" target="_blank">Parfrey lab</a>, I am directly addressing this lack of understanding by conducting highly replicated lab and field studies and partnering with the kelp growing industry. I am passionate about challenging established assumptions about how kelps will respond to climate change. I pull in other researchers' datasets to stress test my own findings and work in R to produce highly replicable and accessible data analysis pipelines.</p>
            <h3>Thesis questions and goals</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>How does salinity alter the microbiome of sugar kelp (<em>Saccharina latissima</em>)? *Currently available as a pre-print on <a href='https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.07.570704v1' target="_blank">BioRXiv</a>.</li>
                <li>How do kelps acquire their microbiome in the wild and throughout the production process?</li>
                <li>Characterizing kelp diseases: Kelp diseases are already killing up to 20% of farmers' crops yearly. Disease occurrence is predicted to increase as the kelp industry grows and as climate change worsens. I am currently working on characterizing "pink spots on spools" (see this <a href='https://hub.greenwave.org/community/topic/713/kelp-disease-pink-non-cyanobacteria-spots-on-spools/3' target="_blank">blog post</a>), but I am interested in any and all kelp diseases! Watch me <a href="https://youtu.be/5zUeOMgrsFE?si=4gJ-l2zu503dCU1Q" target="_blank">talk about</a> the "pink spots on spools".</li>

         <h2>Triathlon</h2>
<p>I really enjoy being active and being outside. Triathlon is a great sport because it combines both of those! </p> 
<p>I am on the <a href='https://recreation.ubc.ca/sport-clubs/triathlon-sc/' target="_blank">2023-2024 UBC Triathlon Sports Club team</a>.</p> 
<p>I qualified for 70.3 World Championshios in Taupō, New Zealand, which will take place in December 2024. </p>
