<h1>About me</h1>

<h2>Data Science and Open Data Access</h2>
<p>A lot of research time and money is spent collecting data. However these data are often lost, not useable due to poor reccord keeping/being behind a paywall, or the analysis cannot be replicated. I am determined to change this though my own work and hope to help others do the same.</p>

<h3>Formal Data Analysis Consulting Experience</h3>

<ol>

<li><strong> Data Analysis and Visualization GAA for the UBC Library:</strong> I provide one on one consultation for UBC students, staff, and Alumni who need help performing their data analysis in R and SPSS. Additionally, I develop and deliver workshops for the UBC Research Commons aimed at beginner R users. The workshops are designed to walk the participants though how the R programming language operates and how to take advantage of commonly used R packages.</li>

<li><strong>Living Data Project Data Rescue Intern:</strong> I cleaned over 20 years of field data,which directly lead to an <a href='https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.4013' target="_blank"> open access publication in <em>Ecology</em>.</a></li>

<li><strong>Illumina Data Analyst for the publication </strong><a href='https://ami-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1462-2920.16582' target="_blank">"Manipulation of the seagrass-associated microbiome reduces disease severity". </a></li>

</ol>

<h3>Other Data Accessibility Projects</h3>

<ol>

<li><strong>Gathering baseline macoralgae data at an unban intertidal site</strong>: There is a lack of publicly accessible baseline data in ecology in general. My colleges and I are working to change this for our local macroalgae (big seaweeds) by conducting montly transect sampling at Stanley Park. We publish our data on an <a href='https://borealisdata.ca/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.5683/SP3/IKGB6E' target="_blank">open access database</a> and I developed an <a href='https://siobhanschenk.shinyapps.io/algae_transects_stanley_park/' target="_blank">RShiny app</a> for easier data visualization.</li>

<h2>Kelps and Microbial Ecology</h2>
<p>Kelps are vital for the health of temperate coastlines, privinding habitat, food, and modifying water conditions within their canopy. Additionally, kelp farming is a gorwing industry, already worth billions of dollars anually. However, wild and farmed kelps are vulnerable to climate change. Thus, these valuable services kelp provide are at risk.</p>
<p>Microbes, bacteria in particular, have been used as a toolkit to increase terrestiral crop resistance to unfavourable conditions for a logn time now, but we have a much more limited understanding of the bacterial community of kelps and other marine life than in terrestrial systems.</p>
<p>Through my PhD thesis work in the <a href = "https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~parfrey/parfrey_lab/" target="_blank">Parfrey lab</a>, I am directly addressing this lack of understanding by conducting highly replicated lab and field studies and partnering with the kelp growing industry. I am passionate about chllenging established asusmptions about how kelps wil respond to climate change. I pull in other researchers datasets to stress test my own findings and work in R to produce hihgly replicable and accesible data analysis pipelines.</p>

<h3>Thesis questions and goals</h3>

<ol>

<li>How does salinity alter the microbiome of sugar kelp (<em>Saccharina latissima</em> (sugar kelp)? *Currently available as a pre-print on <a href='https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.07.570704v1' target="_blank">BioRXiv</a>.</li>

<li>How do kelps aquire their microbiome in the wild and throughout the production process?</li>

<li><strong>Characterizing kelp diseases:</strong> Kelp diseases are already killing up to 20% of farmers crops yearly. Disease occurence is predicted to increase as the kelp industry grows nd as climate change worsens. I am currently working on characterizing <a href='https://hub.greenwave.org/community/topic/713/kelp-disease-pink-non-cyanobacteria-spots-on-spools/3' target="_blank">"pink spots on spools"</a>, but I am interested in any and all kelp diseases!</li>

<h2>Triathlon</h2>
<p>I really enjoy being active and being outside. Triathlon is a great sport because it combines both of those! I have competed in the 2022 Vancouver Triathlon (Standard Distance), the 2023 Victoria half-Ironman, and I am on the <a href='https://recreation.ubc.ca/sport-clubs/triathlon-sc/' target="_blank">2023-2024 UBC Triathlon Sports Club team</a>. </p>
